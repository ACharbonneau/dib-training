Workshop description:

Want to make pretty, dynamic, and interactive data visualizations like
http://charts.animateddata.co.uk/ukwind/ and
http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/iris-splom.html? D3 (which
stands for Data Driven Documents) is a Javascript library that enables
you to display data in a flexible way. Since it's a Javascript
library, these visualizations can easily be shared either offline or
via the internet. The option to add interactive elements to your
visualization lends itself to making your data easy for others to
explore. We'll be running a 3-hour workshop covering the basics of 
using d3.js to visualize data. No
prior web programming experience required (we'll teach you the
necessary Javascript and html), but this workshop is aimed at people
who already feel comfortable programming in at least one language.

Locations

The workshop will be livestreamed via Google Hangouts to YouTube.  In

University (East Lansing, MI); UC Davis (Davis, CA); and two additional
locations.
