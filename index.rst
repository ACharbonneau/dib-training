Welcome to the Data Intensive Biology training program Web site!
================================================================

.. @add link to GC

This is the overview Web site for the Data Intensive Biology training
program at UC Davis, run by Dr. C. Titus Brown.  This is a series of
workshops primarily focused on sequence analysis, using a short-course
format taken from the `Next-Gen Sequence Analysis Workshops
<http://angus.readthedocs.org/>`__ and inspired by `Software Carpentry
<http://software-carpentry.org/>`__ and `Data Carpentry
<http://datacarpentry.org>`__.

You can be notified of new workshops by signing up for the
`dib-training mailing list
<http://lists.idyll.org/listinfo/dib-training>`__.
