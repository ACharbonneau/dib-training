Description
-----------

This two-day hands-on workshop will introduce biologists to `Project
Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`__ (formerly IPython Notebook).  We will
assume some minimal experience with Python, but no previous experience
with Project Jupyter is required.

Project Jupyter is a literate data analysis environment (similar to
knitr and Shiny) that supports over 40 different programming
languages, including R and Python both.  It can be used to build
reproducible analyses for publication, collaborate over distances on
data analysis, and build interactive tutorials and homeworks around
data analysis.

Topics overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the first day, we will start with a hands-on tour of Project
Jupyter in Python.

The remaining day and a half will be devoted to hands-on experimentation
with Project Jupyter features and plugins, including:

* d3.js / JavaScript widgets inside of notebooks;
* building plugins;
* writing slideshows;
* `JupyterHub <https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub/blob/master/README.md>`__
* independent challenge exercises.
