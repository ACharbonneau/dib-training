this workshop will give you some exposure to it.  We will be covering
the basics, including fundamental concepts such as loops, creating
functions, and debugging.  Some experience working with a scripting
language (e.g. R or Python) is recommended but not necessary.

Computer and workshop requirements
----------------------------------

Attendees will need to bring a computer with an Internet connection.

Please install Python 3.x before the workshop by following the
instructions below.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

`Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ is a very powerful programming
language.  For this workshop, we will be working with Python 3.  In
order to avoid downloading all of its scientific packages
individually, we will use `Anaconda
<https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda>`__ as an all-in-one installer.

Windows:

1. Go to `https://www.continuum.io/downloads <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__.
2. Download Python 3.x (3.4 is fine) 64-bit graphical installer for Windows, *not* Python 2.7.
3. Install Python 3.x using all defaults *except* make sure to check **Make Anaconda the default Python**.

OS X:

1. Go to `https://www.continuum.io/downloads <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__.
2. Download Python 3.x (3.4 is fine) 64-bit graphical installer for OS X, *not* Python 2.7.
3. Install Python 3.x using all defaults.

Once installation is complete, please go to `this page
<http://bids.github.io/2016-01-14-berkeley/setup/index.html>`__ to
test that Python has installed correctly.  If you do not have bash
installed, please refer to the installation instructions at the bottom
of `this page
<http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/2015-12-03-shell-halfday.html>`__.
