Description
-----------

This two-day workshop is for exploring the use of `Docker
<http://www.docker.com>`__ containers for running, wrapping,
distributing, and publishing scientific workflows.  Docker containers
provide a lightweight computational framework for all of these things,
and we intend that this workshop will provide a friendly and welcoming
environment for trying it out.

People new to docker are welcome to attend!  We do suggest that attendees
have some familiarity with the UNIX command line.

Planned activities:

* Monday morning will start with an introduction to Docker, using the
  Amazon cloud to provide a consistent computing environment.

* We'll provide "challenge exercises" for people who want to play with Docker
  themselves.

* We're particularly interested in trying out `mybinder.org
  <http://mybinder.org>`__, which takes a git repo and turns it into a
  running data analysis environment.

* We'd like to explore data volumes and the use of Docker for data-intensive
  research.

* We'd also like to gain some experience with people installing Docker
  locally on their Windows and Mac laptops.

* `Bioboxes <http://bioboxes.org/>`__ looks interesting and we'd love
  to play with it!

Some reading:

* `An introduction to Docker for reproducible research <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2723872.2723882>`__, Carl Boettiger, 2015.

* `Bioboxes <http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/4/1/47>`__, Belmann et al., 2015.

* `The impact of Docker containers on the performance of genomic pipelines <https://peerj.com/preprints/1171/>`__, Di Tommaso et al., 2015.
