Description
-----------

This two-day hands-on workshop will introduce biologists to doing de
novo transcriptome analysis with khmer and Trinity.  The primary focus
will be on non-model organisms - organisms with no reference genome
and poor gene annotations.  The workshop will be eukaryote-focused
(poly-A mRNA/large genomes/genes with introns).

We will be analyzing a stock data set, and we will be using the Amazon
cloud.

Topics overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Non-model organisms and RNAseq: an overview of the options
* Logging into the Amazon Cloud
* Short read quality and trimming
* Building a new reference transcriptome with khmer and Trinity
* Data analysis & differential expression

The materials will be based off of `the Eel Pond mRNAseq protocol
<https://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mrnaseq/index.html>`__,
and we will link to the final workshop materials from this site.  All
materials will be available indefinitely after the workshop.

Schedule
~~~~~~~~

* Mon, 9am-noon: Amazon cloud, read trimming, basic sequence cleaning
* Mon, noon-1pm: lunch
* Mon, 1-3pm, assembly

* Tuesday, 9am-noon: mapping, annotation
* Tuesday, noon-1pm: lunch
* Tuesday, 1pm-3pm: quantification and differential expression analysis

Computer requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attendees will need to bring a computer with a Web browser, an
Internet connection, and an ssh client; Windows users should install
`MobaXterm <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`__ before the workshop.
