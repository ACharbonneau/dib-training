Description
-----------

This two-day hands-on workshop will introduce biologists to doing
reference-based transcriptome analysis with TopHat, Cufflinks, and
DAVID.  The primary focus will be on "semi-model" organisms -
organisms with good quality reference genomes but relatively
incomplete gene annotations.  This includes most animals and plants
that are not a major model organism.  The workshop will be
eukaryote-focused (large genomes, and genes with introns).

We will be analyzing a stock data set, and we will be using the Amazon
cloud.

Topics overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Semi-model organisms and RNAseq: an overview of the options
* Logging into the Amazon Cloud
* Short read quality and trimming
* Building a new reference transcriptome with TopHat and Cufflinks
* Mapping reads to the transcriptome with TopHat
* Processing another sample with TopHat and HTSeq
* Data analysis & differential expression

The materials will be based off of `these materials from a 2014 course
held at MSU
<http://2014-msu-rnaseq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/semi-orgs.html>`__,
and we will link to the updated materials from this site.  All materials
will be available indefinitely after the workshop.

A more detailed schedule will be posted prior to the workshop.  Note that
attendees should plan to be at the entire workshop.

Computer requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Attendees will need to bring a computer with a Web browser, an
Internet connection, and an ssh client; Windows users should install
`MobaXterm <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`__ before the workshop.
